# Implement Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and PyTorch.

* Implement a simple ANN for classification (e.g., MNIST / any small dataset).
* Implement a CNN for image classification (MNIST / CIFAR-10 preferred).

* Code must include:

       * Data loading & preprocessing
       * Model architecture
       * Training loop (forward pass, loss, backpropagation, optimizer)
